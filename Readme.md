# RandomnessBeacon

This project contains an implementation of the distributed randomness beacon proposed in `Practical Distributed Randomness Beacon with Optimal Communication Complexity`.

How to use:

1. To build the beacon distributed key generation (DKG), use the following commands: `cd dkg` and `sudo make build`.

2. To build the beacon nodes, use the following commands: `cd node` and `sudo make build`.

3. To start the beacon, use the following commands: `cd node` and `sudo sh start.sh`.

4. To stop the beacon use the following commands: `cd node` and `sudo sh end.sh`.
